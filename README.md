🏗️ Project Overview
This is a web-based application designed to digitize hostel operations. It connects Admins, Principals, Wardens, Students, and Guardians on a single platform to manage registrations, room allocations, attendance, and facility monitoring efficiently.

Tech Stack:

Backend: Python (Flask)
Database: SQLite
Frontend: HTML, CSS (Glassmorphism design), Jinja2 Templating
Security: Password Hashing (werkzeug), Session Management, OTP Email Verification
⚙️ Working Rules & User Roles
The system operates on a hierarchy where higher-level users approve lower-level users. Here is the breakdown of each role:

1. 👑 Admin (Super User)
Credentials: Pre-configured (Username: admin, Password:admin123).
Role: The highest authority.
Workflow:
Logs in to the Admin Dashboard.
Views a list of Principals who have registered but are not yet approved.
Approves Principals, effectively registering a new College in the system.
Can view a list of all registered colleges and their principals.
2. 🎓 Principal (College Head)
Registration: Registers with a College Name. Must be approved by the Admin.
Role: Manages their specific college's users and approvals.
Workflow:
User Approval: Sees a list of pending Students and Wardens who registered under their college name. They must approve them before they can log in.
Room Allocation: Receives notifications when a student applies for a specific room. The Principal approves the request, and the system automatically updates the room's occupancy.
Dashboard: Views total student counts and pending applications.
3. 👮 Warden (Hostel Manager)
Registration: Registers under a specific college. Must be approved by the Principal.
Role: Manages the physical hostel, rooms, and discipline.
Workflow:
Hostel Creation: Adds new hostels and defines the total number of rooms. The system automatically generates room numbers (e.g., R1, R2).
Room Management: Updates room details like Capacity, Facilities (AC, Fan, WiFi), and Damage Reports.
Attendance: Marks daily attendance (Present/Absent) for students.
Photos: Uploads photos of specific rooms for students to see.
4. 🎒 Student (Resident)
Registration: Registers with personal details, College Name, and uploads an ID Card. Must be approved by the Principal.
Role: End-user looking for accommodation.
Workflow:
Browse Rooms: Views available rooms in their college's hostels. They can see occupancy bars (e.g., 2/3 full), facilities, and condition/damage reports.
Apply: Clicks "Apply" for a specific room.
Status: Once approved by the Principal, they can see their allocated room details on their dashboard.
Attendance: Views their own attendance history.
5. 👤 Guardian (Parent)
Registration: Registers to track their ward.
Role: Observer.
Workflow:
Logs in to view the Attendance Record of their student to ensure they are present in the hostel.
🔄 Key System Processes
The Approval Chain:

User Registers -> Status is Pending (Cannot Login).
Admin approves Principal.
Principal approves Warden & Student.
Status becomes Approved -> User can Login.
Room Allocation Logic:

A student applies for Room A.
Principal approves.
System checks: Is Occupied < Capacity?
If yes: Occupied count + 1, Student assigned to Room A.
If no: System prevents allocation (Room Full).
Forgot Password:

Uses OTP (One Time Password) verification via Email.
OTP is valid for 5 minutes.
Data Isolation:

Principals, Wardens, and Students can only see data related to their specific College. They cannot see data from other colleges registered in the system.
